# Regression Machine Learning

## Goals of the Project
- Prepare data for regression machine learning
- Visualize data to understand relationships between predictors and response
- Create machine learning models to predict response
  - Random Forest
  - K Nearest Neighbors
  - Support Vector Regression
- Analyze accuracy of predictions
  - Compare predictions with response
  - Understand relationship between predictors and absolute prediction difference
